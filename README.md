## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.9+ installed
*   `pip` (Python package installer)
*   `git` (for cloning the repository)
*   An [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/) account and an API Key (Free tier is usually sufficient for testing).
*   `ngrok` executable installed and authenticated (download from [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/) and run `ngrok authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN`).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[YourGitHubUsername]/gmat_ai_project.git
    cd gmat_ai_project
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```powershell
    python -m venv venv
    . .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```
    *   **Note for PowerShell users:** If you encounter an error related to script execution, run `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser` once, then try activating again.

3.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *   If `requirements.txt` is missing, you can generate a basic one with `pip freeze > requirements.txt` (after installing necessary packages like Flask, langchain-openai, pydantic) or create it manually with:
        ```
        flask
        langchain-openai
        pydantic
        python-dotenv
        ```

### Environment Variables (`.env`)

Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project directory (where `app.py` is located) and add your OpenRouter API key and desired model:

*   **Important:** Replace `YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual key from OpenRouter.ai.
*   The `deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528-qwen3-8b:free` model is used by default as it's often available on the free tier. You can change this to another model supported by OpenRouter if needed.

## üèÉ Running the Application

You'll need two separate terminal windows for this:

### Terminal Window 1: Flask Application

1.  **Navigate to your project directory (if not already there):**
    ```powershell
    cd "C:\Users\YourUsername\OneDrive\Desktop\gmat_ai_project"
    ```
    *(Adjust the path to your actual project location)*

2.  **Activate your virtual environment:**
    ```powershell
    . .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

3.  **Run the Flask application:**
    ```powershell
    python app.py
    ```
    You should see output similar to `* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. **Keep this window open and running.**

### Terminal Window 2: ngrok Tunnel

1.  **Open a *new*, separate PowerShell window.**

2.  **Navigate to your project directory (where `ngrok.exe` is located):**
    ```powershell
    cd "C:\Users\YourUsername\OneDrive\Desktop\gmat_ai_project"
    ```
    *(Adjust the path to your actual project location, or to wherever your ngrok.exe is)*

3.  **Start ngrok to expose your Flask app to the internet:**
    ```powershell
    .\ngrok.exe http 5000
    ```
    ngrok will start and display a `Forwarding` URL (e.g., `https://xxxx-xx-xx-xx-xx.ngrok-free.app`). **Copy this URL.**

## üåê Integrating with Make.com

1.  Go to your Make.com (formerly Integromat) scenario where you've set up your workflow.
2.  In your HTTP module, **update the URL** to the `Forwarding` URL you copied from your `ngrok` terminal.
3.  Ensure your HTTP module is configured to send a `POST` request with a `Content-Type: application/json` header and a JSON request body (e.g., `{"topic": "Algebra", "difficulty": "Medium"}` for `/generate_question`).
4.  Run your Make.com scenario to see the full flow in action!

## üß™ API Endpoints

The Flask application exposes the following RESTful API endpoints:

### 1. `POST /generate_question`

*   **Description:** Generates a GMAT-style quantitative question with multiple-choice options, a detailed explanation, and the correct answer.
*   **Request Body (JSON):**
    ```json
    {
        "topic": "Algebra",   # Optional, default is "Algebra"
        "difficulty": "Medium" # Optional, default is "Medium". Options: "Easy", "Medium", "Hard"
    }
    ```
*   **Example Response (JSON):**
    ```json
